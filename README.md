## How I Build 🔧

- **Frontend Development:** We developed the frontend using React to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Smart Contracts:** Using Solidity, we crafted smart contracts to handle rental agreements and transactions. These contracts were deployed on the Ethereum blockchain using Remix IDE.
- **Blockchain Interaction:** We utilized Ether.js to interact with the deployed smart contracts, ensuring smooth and secure communication between the frontend and blockchain.
- **Database Management:** MongoDB was employed to store metadata related to users, vehicles, and rental transactions.
- **Authentication:** Firebase was integrated for user authentication, providing a secure login and registration system.

## Challenges I Ran Into 💀

- **Fetching Data from Blockchain:** We encountered difficulties in fetching and formatting data from the blockchain due to differences in data formats.
- **Smart Contract Interaction:** Interacting with the smart contracts using Ether.js posed challenges, especially due to version differences.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Ensuring real-time updates and synchronization between the blockchain and frontend required meticulous handling and optimization.
